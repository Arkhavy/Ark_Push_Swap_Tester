# Push_Swap Arktester
This tester is my first ever bash script, if something does not work correctly, feel free to mention it to me !

### How to use it ?
1. git clone https://github.com/Arkhavy/Push_Swap_arktester.git where your binary is located
2. Make sure your checker and your binary exist
3. Rename the checker in the script if needed *(default is checker_Mac)*
4. cd Push_Swap_arktester
5. bash ark_push_swap_test.sh
6. Brace yourself

## ATTENTION
- The script is currently a Work In Progress
- **The script might give you some random CKO, feel free to launch it again two or more times**
- There is more than 4500 tests done, hope your body is ready *(and your terminal too)*
- All tests above 6 digits are made without too much tests on my end, if something doesn't work, it's my fault, not yours
- I will add some flags in the future to do only some tests and not everything
- I will add a trace in the future to show where it doesn't work and help solve your problems
- Parsing errors tests, norm test and timeout tests are currently non existent, they will be added in the future
- Any feedback is appreciated, any idea for more features too !
